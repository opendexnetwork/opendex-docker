A complete [opendexd](https://github.com/opendexnetwork/opendexd) environment using [docker](https://www.docker.com/), made for liquidity providers on the OpenDEX Network.

Two ways to become a liquidity provider:
- run the ðŸ‘‰ [desktop app](https://opendex-desktop.app/) ðŸ‘ˆ on your pc or
- use the ðŸ‘‰ [cli-based setup](https://opendex.network/docs) ðŸ‘ˆ on your server 

### Basic Usage via CLI

Use command-line user interface by running `opendex.sh` script.

```
bash opendex.sh
```

Use the launcher for advanced control over the whole environment.

```
make launcher
cd launcher && ./launcher help
```
